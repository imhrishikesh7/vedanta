                    Copper’s Tuticorin plant</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    In 2018, Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper plant in Tuticorin began facing persistent protests by members from the local community, on allegations of pollution and impacts to health. The protests resulted in closure notices being issued
                    by the State Pollution Control Board, which was eventually upheld by the Madras High Court. This order was challenged
                    by the company in the Supreme Court of India. In FY 2024, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Madras High Court and the plant remains shut as of this writing.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    While the battle has played out in the
                    Courts, the company
                    has undertaken several measures to regain our social license to operate. Additionally, learnings from Tuticorin have
                    also been incorporated
                    in Vedanta’s social performance standards for external stakeholder engagement and grievance mechanisms.
                </p>
                <p className='font-bold text-xl mb-2'>Rebuilding Community Trust</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    Since 2018, the Sterlite Copper team has instituted a program for “Community Connects” to have a systematic platform to engage in dialogue with local stakeholders. These conversations helped the company evolve CSR activities that better addressed community needs – including programs that supply potable water to villages.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    A breakdown of our stakeholder engagement strategy is given below:
                </p>
                <p className='font-bold text-xl mb-2 text-[#0066ab]'>1. Engaging key stakeholders</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    To regain a foothold in the community, the Company spent several hours engaging with community representatives such as village presidents, village elders, and other influential members of the community.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    These interactions allowed us to understand community concerns, provide explanations about the Company’s operations, practices, and future plans, and determine how the company can remain involved in the community.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    Over time, the company has been able
                    to build a collaborative and consultative relationship with the community.
                </p>

                <p className='font-bold text-xl mb-2 text-[#0066ab]'>2. Assisting during crisis</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    The Sterlite Copper team has been one of the first responders during times of crisis for the community.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    During the COVID-19 outbreak, we sought special permission from the Courts
                    to restart our oxygen plant, in order to provide much-needed oxygen for COVID- patients.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    In December 2023, Tuticorin received unprecedented rainfall cause flooding, damage to property and threat to life. Sterlite Copper’s swift response of providing food packets and dry rations helped bring timely relief and played
                    a crucial role in strengthening our relationship with the community.
                </p>

                <p className='font-bold text-xl mb-2 text-[#0066ab]'>3. Building trust</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    A significant part of our community outreach involved addressing misinformation about the company’s operations. This included explanations on how we minimized pollution, local hiring and procurement practices, and improvement projects undertaken as part of our CSR initiatives.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    We ensured that we reached out to all
                    types of stakeholders – members from the fishing community, local traders, students, academia, and members of various religious denominations. We also reached out to those persons with disabilities and members from the transgender community who were often times used as frontline protestors.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    These interactions helped personify the company and helped improve the perception about the Tuticorin plant.
                </p>

                <p className='font-bold text-xl mb-2 text-[#0066ab]'>4. Involving the community</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    The Tuticorin location always had a strong CSR program. The Company continued to provided support to those programs, even after the plant was ordered to be shut.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    Village development centers served as focal points for implementing developmental activities. Projects that we have continued to support over the last year, include ensuring availability of potable water and the skill- center for community youth.
                </p>

                <p className='font-bold text-xl mb-2'>An ongoing commitment</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    Notwithstanding, the judgement of the Supreme Court of India, our interactions reveal that community members have a more favourable perception of the plant that what was the case in 2018. However, we remain cognizant that perceptions can turn quickly, and our efforts with grassroots engagement continue.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-2'>
                    Our goal is singular, should the plant be allowed to reopen, it should be with the backing of the local community.

                Approach to Materiality Assessment
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
                Vedanta reviewed its material topics in FY 2024 as part of its annual process. In FY 2023, Vedanta Limited undertook a detailed evaluation to identify sustainability/ESG issues that are of material importance to execute its business strategy and growth plan. Furthermore, three of our businesses - namely Vedanta Aluminium, Cairn India, and Hindustan Zinc Limited conducted independent assessments of ESG topics impacting their businesses. The overall assessment approach played a crucial role
                in appraising the risks and opportunities that Vedanta and its businesses may face as well as in refining our ESG strategy. The comprehensive assessment attempted to follow the principles of double materiality, which involved assessing the impact of Vedanta’s operations on stakeholders (impact materiality), as well as, in some cases, evaluating the reciprocal impact of society and the environment on Vedanta (financial materiality).
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg font-[600] text-[#0066ab] mb-3'>
                The three pillars that constitute our sustainability strategy – Transforming Communities, Transforming the Planet and Transforming the Workplace and the nine subsidiary aims, are all closely linked with our material issues.

                <p>
                    The process of identifying industry-specific material topics involved several steps. Initially, material topics were selected based on recommendations from four industry standards: SASB, MSCI, S&P Global, and ICMM, which guided the relevance assessment of various topics. Following this, a peer review was conducted to evaluate sustainability topics deemed important by peer companies of Vedanta. Ultimately, a comprehensive and prioritized list of 26 material topics was developed using a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) approach to streamline their relevance for Vedanta.

                <p>
                    After identifying 26 key material topics for Vedanta, the next step involved prioritization. We engaged a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, totaling 1,933 individuals, to gather their perspectives on the impact of these topics on both them and the organization. This involved various interaction methods such as interviews, focus group discussions, surveys, and site visits, providing qualitative and quantitative insights into stakeholders’ perceptions of Vedanta’s environmental and social impacts relative to their interests and concerns.

                <p>
                    We conducted a thorough analysis of identified material topics to evaluate their potential impact on our ‘Transforming for Good’ strategy, emphasizing those with significant financial implications. These topics were then assessed against Vedanta’s Enterprise Risk Management matrix to determine their risk thresholds. This assessment enabled
                    us to gauge the level of risk associated with each topic and devise tailored mitigation strategies accordingly.

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    After analyzing stakeholder feedback and conducting a thorough risk assessment, we employed a scoring method to evaluate the severity and likelihood of each material issue. This allowed us to categorize these issues into high, medium, and low priorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our prioritization strategy balances financial significance, focusing on topics that strongly influence our enterprise value, with impact significance, which considers issues that profoundly affect stakeholders, the environment, economy, and society. By integrating both financial and non-financial impacts, we aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the importance of these issues, alongside the corresponding risks and opportunities.

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    Stakeholder responses were meticulously analyzed and mapped onto a materiality matrix, employing two axes
                    to assess the significance of material issues. The X-axis evaluated the impact on Vedanta’s business, with varying weightages assigned based on their relative influence. This process identified high-priority material issues and their implications for Vedanta’s operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Y-axis, business prioritization considered Vedanta’s strategic goals, ESG-related risks within the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, and the scope of these material topics across the value chain. Material issues were categorized as high, medium, or low priority based on their impact, guiding the development of focused management strategies tailored to address each issue effectively.

                    In the validation phase, the results of the materiality assessment underwent a thorough review by Vedanta’s corporate ESG team and was signed off by the ESG Management Committee. This critical step ensured the relevance, accuracy, and completeness of the materiality matrix. As part of our annual assurance process, third-party agency validated our materiality approach and assessed its relevance to our business and industry sector.

            <p className='mb-2'>
            To ensure alignment with our organizational direction, we conducted an evaluation to verify that all ESG-related risks identified as primary and emerging risks within our risk management framework align with high-priority material topics. This assessment aimed to ensure a cohesive and integrated approach to managing risk and sustainability.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
            Additionally, this exercise enabled us to assess emerging risks, global trends, and regulatory changes for their significant impact on key aspects of our business model, including revenue growth, margins, and capital requirements. These topics were evaluated against Vedanta's risk tolerance as defined in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. For example, climate change and decarbonization, identified as high-priority material topics, are categorized as "principal risks" within our ERM framework, highlighting their potential broad impacts on our operations.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
            Integrating materiality assessment with ERM allows us to align our sustainability strategy with our risk management framework effectively. This integration informs our internal decision-making by considering a comprehensive set of metrics, such as changes in profitability, liquidity, and capital provisioning. Governance of the materiality assessment ensures a well-regulated and structured process to guide our strategic initiatives.
