                Our performance management process is closely aligned with our business goals and strategic priorities, with employee Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) directly supporting our business targets, agile conversation, and team bases performance. We conduct performance reviews semi-annually for all employees, and quarterly for senior managers and key talents identified through talent management initiatives.

            <p className='mb-2'>
                Each employee is assessed semi- annually against predefined goals set in consultation with their line managers. Additionally, senior leaders undergo a 360-degree evaluation as part of their annual performance assessment.
                At Vedanta, we adhere to SMARTER (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time Bound, Excellence Oriented, Rigorous) goal-setting principles, focusing on four major tracks:

                Our performance management system has been streamlined through Darwin Box, providing a unified digital platform for KPI setting, reviews, feedback, and record-keeping. While we encourage one-on-one discussions and feedback sessions offline, outcomes are documented in the system for transparency and tracking purposes.

                Overall, our performance appraisal and management processes ensure that all employees at Vedanta are effectively evaluated and supported in their professional growth and contributions to organizational success.

            <p className='mb-2 mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-[#44b9b6]'>Succession Planning: </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
                Succession Planning is critical to
                the success of the Company as it ensures continuity and sustainability of corporate performance. It involves a process that recognises, develops, and retains top leadership talent and further helps in identifying key roles and mapping out ways to ensure the organisation has the right people
                with the right blend of skills, aptitude, expertise, and experiences, in the right place and at the right time. As per the NRC Policy of the Company, the NRC has laid a succession plan outlining the process for retaining, developing, and/ or appointing the Board of Directors, KMPs and SMPs of the Company and it reviews such plans on an annual basis and recommend revisions, if any, to the Board.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
                The primary goal of this initiative has been to establish a comprehensive three-level succession slate for Chief Operating Officers (COOs) across our key business units. We have achieved this by utilizing a combination of internal job postings (IJPs) and meticulous selection of outstanding leaders to identify potential successors for each COO position. Our recently launched Emerging Leaders programme will be carrying forward with this exercise. The programme focuses on identifying and placing
                high-potential talent in Deputy CXO roles across businesses, strategic business units (SBUs), and functions. We are also prioritizing on identifying successors for other executive positions like Deputy Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) roles within each business division, through this programme.

            <p className='mb-2 mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-[#44b9b6]'>Satisfaction Survey </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
            In FY 2024, Vedanta conducted the HWA Employee Satisfaction Survey to gain deeper insights into employee expectations and work-related experiences. This survey, based on 
            a comprehensive questionnaire, assessed various aspects, including the Happiness Index, Professional Index, Manager Index, and Senior Leader (Intent) Index. The survey was conducted anonymously, ensuring that employees could provide honest feedback. The insights gathered from this survey will be instrumental in fostering a more conducive and rewarding work environment.
